# Learning by doing

Learning by doing is not invented by us, but the American philosopher John Dewey. Such learning method puts a heavy emphasis on student engagement. This approach upended the traditional notion that learning happens through lectures and rote memorization. Dewey became famous by arguing that we learn best when we deeply engage with the material. It might be arguable in learning math, history, and geography. But totally true for learning programming.
