As awesome as it would be to become the next Bill Gates on your own, the reality is that people learn faster with mentors and peer feedback. What may seem like an immovable bug or topic could be quickly alleviated by a fresh pair of eyes or a new interpretation of the subject. Whether it’s online or in-person, ignore the trolls and don’t be afraid to ask for help, because every programmer has been in your shoes before. Besides, most developers love to code, and if there’s one thing that passionate individuals enjoy, it’s to share their knowledge with others.
Google,  stackoverlfow and github, all are gold mines for online programming assistance. We are deeply involved in these programmer community and provide assistance to those known and unknown. Don’t just laugh at those jokes about github, enjoy them. 
See SUPPORT at the end of this chapter. We are there for you.
