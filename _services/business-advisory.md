The fundamentals may not be beautiful but they are reused everywhere. As elementary as they may appear at first, programming fundamentals always need to come first: the better you understand them, the easier it is to learn more advanced concepts.

This book identifies Android fundamentals as the CORE. We explain the CORE with cases instead of just theory. Practice the CORE a couple of times until you truly fully understand it, or at least memorize it. You will keep using them again and again in the future. 
From unknown to core is a big jump, while from core to full functional is just a small step. We sliced the core parts from the full functional app and explain them clearly so that you could grasp the fundamental in no time. Besides, we embed the core with a workable case so that you wonâ€™t be lost among those concepts.
