Learn Android App developing from scratch, and practise in a real environment. Throughout this case study book, you will learn the fundamental Android concepts as well as the practical skills. 
You will read short and concise description, solve problems,  create projects, and explore simple but complete cases, step by step. Going through 22 cases in this book, you will grow from an Android App novice to  an expert. 
Hands-on App Development in Android Studio 4.2 is suitable for beginners who have never written a line of code. No matter you are a student or a job hunter, you will find this case-study approach is extremely helpful for Android learning.

Learning by doing is not invented by us, but the American philosopher John Dewey. Such learning method puts a heavy emphasis on student engagement. This approach upended the traditional notion that learning happens through lectures and rote memorization. Dewey became famous by arguing that we learn best when we deeply engage with the material. It might be arguable in learning math, history, and geography. But totally true for learning programming.
With every new Android subject, the sooner you start playing with the code, the faster you will learn the concepts. Even if you blaze through an entire chapter of reading and a topic like ListView seems straightforward – so a monkey could do it – you’ll still be scratching your head when tasked to implement the code. You’ll think, “wait, what was that one piece of syntax again?” As the saying goes, you need to “use it or lose it”, because despite the evolution of technology, this ole’ proverb holds true when learning to code.
Actually, few people will doubt the concept. The real question is: what I’m going to do? 
The answer is case study. Harvard adopted case method in their business school and soon became #1 in the world. Following the workable cases, re-do it is just the best way to learn a new language like Android. You could practise with these cases. If succeed, put the new knowledge in brain and move on to next case. If not, compare the case you are reading and what you did and get what you are missing. You will grow fast with that.
